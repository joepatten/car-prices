## Car Prices

In car_prices.ipynb, I first clean the data found in imports-85.data. imports-85.data can be found at this ![link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile). Each row in the dataset includes values describing attributes of certain cars. A few of these attributes include:

- price (in dollars)
- make
- fuel type
- number of doors
- mpg (in the city and highway)

I then use K-Nearest Neighbors to come up with a model to predict the price of cars given its attributes.
